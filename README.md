# ML-KNN-ANN
self implemented KNN &amp; ANN- using random forest

-KNN algorithm finds for each point in our data it's nearest neighbor. In our case 'nearnest' would be messured by euclidean distance.

-ANN algorithm finds for each point in our data it's approximate nearest neighbor.
implementation of the algorithm using RKDT-  building a forest of kd trees using the training data.

-Optimaizing hyper parameter using grid search:performing the grid search in order to find the best hyperparameter for our ANN algorithm.

-Demonstration of accuracy vs. running time trade-off

- comparrison between self implemented KNN &ANN and sklearn implementation.
